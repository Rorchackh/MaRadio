A very custom-made, but simple, radio app for my personal use.

This app loads custom radio lists from Google Firebase's Real time Database, giving me the ability to edit the app without a reinstall or even a restart.

I have made this in order to combine my favorite channels from Morocco, Denmark, USA, and France into one single app, without having to use a large ad-supported alternative like Tune in.

Side Notes:
* This is an Android app that can run on minimum SDK level of 16 (Android 4.1).
* You will need to supply your own Firebase credentials file (google-services.json) to run this app. Put this file in the app/ directory.
